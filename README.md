I have no way to sustain this extension on GPUs so I thought it's best to just release this to yall. install it and translate videos into your native tongue.

I built this because I was trying to understand something about a really obscure paper and the only resource I found on the whole internet was in chinese.
I converted it locally and then figured if this was helpful for me then others might benefit too, so here's the product. Host the 'server/' on cloud and unpack the 'extension/' locally on your browser and you're ready to go.
